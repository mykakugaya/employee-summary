# Employee Summary
https://mykakugaya.github.io/employee-summary/

## Description
This command-line application (powered by jQuery and Node.js) allows the user to build an engineering team consisting of a manager and any number of engineers and interns. It utilizes the inquirer npm to prompt users for each employee's information, asking questions specific to the type of employee being added. Once finished, a neatly formatted team roster HTML page based on user inputs will be created in the output directory. This simple application allows team leaders/managers to easily generate their team's roster and have quick access to employee information such as emails and Github profiles.
